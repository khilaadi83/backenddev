/* To explain the "this" keyword, I'm going to use a simple analogy. It's like when you refer to yourself as "me" or "I". These words are used when you want to indicate that you are the person doing the action or the person to whom something is being done.

In JavaScript, "this" behaves similarly. It refers to the object that is executing the current function. It becomes easier when we consider objects and methods in JavaScript as "people" and "actions" respectively.

Now, let's imagine we have a robot (an object) which can perform some actions (functions). One of those actions is the ability to introduce itself. */
let robot = {
    name: "Merlin",
    introduce: function() {
        console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
    }
};

robot.introduce(); // prints "Hello, my name is Merlin"


/* In this scenario, "this" inside the introduce function refers to the robot object. So, this.name becomes robot.name (which is "Merlin").

Similarly, in your given code, vonageCallerInfo seems to be a method of an object. When you see this.customerWebId or this.callerFirstName, it is setting these properties to the object on which vonageCallerInfo is a method (like our robot above).

When the condition this.orderType === 'PHONE' is met, this.phoneOrderInformation = new vonageCallerInfo(order, request); is setting a new property phoneOrderInformation to our object. This property is an instance of the vonageCallerInfo function.

Just remember, when you see this in a function, think of it as saying "me" or "I", referring to the object that function is a part of. I hope this example helps to clarify how "this" works in JavaScript! Let me know if you have any other questions. */


/* Let's imagine you have a pet dog. Your dog has a name, a color, and some behaviors it can do, like barking.

So, in terms of JavaScript, we could say:


let dog = {
  name: 'Rex',
  color: 'brown',
  bark: function() {
     console.log('Woof! My name is ' + this.name);
  }
};
In the example, dog is an object. It has properties name and color and it has a behavior, bark (which is a function).

The this in this.name is used to refer to the current dog's name property. It’s similar to when you say “my name”; “my” refers to yourself – In JavaScript when we say this.name, this refers to the object which, in this case, is dog.

Now, let's relate this to your code:

When we say this.phoneOrderInformation = new vonageCallerInfo(order, request);, it sets a property phoneOrderInformation for the this object. The new vonageCallerInfo(order, request) part is creating new information which is going to be stored in the phoneOrderInformation property.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have more questions!

Great! I'm glad the previous explanations were helpful. Let's tackle your confusion about the "new" keyword and what "instance" means in programming.

I'll use a real-world example to make it clear. Let's say we are running a car factory. In this factory, we have a blueprint to make a type of car, let's call it "CarModel". This blueprint outlines all the general information that every car of this model will have like color, number of doors, engine type, etc. But this blueprint isn't a car itself, it's just the plan we use to build a car.

In programming, such a blueprint is called a "constructor function". It describes the structure of an object but isn't an object itself. Here's a simple example of a constructor function:


function CarModel(color, doors) {
  this.color = color;
  this.doors = doors;
  this.run = function() {
      console.log('The car is running');
  }
}
Now, when someone orders a car from us, we use this blueprint to create/build the actual car. In programming, we do this by using the "new" keyword. Like so:


let myCar = new CarModel('blue', 4);
Here, myCar is an actual car that was created using the CarModel blueprint (constructor). We can say that myCar is an "instance" of CarModel. Just like a physical car is an instance of the blueprint used to create it.

Now, coming back to your code: The new vonageCallerInfo(order, request) part is creating a new instance (like a new car) of the vonageCallerInfo constructor function (the blueprint).

I hope this clears up the terms "new" and "instance" a bit. Let me know if you need further clarification! */
